# UDI Polyglot v2 Interface Module

This is the Polyglot interface API module that is portable to be imported into your Python 3.4+ based NodeServers.

### Installation

Pip > 9 should be installed. This typically isn't the case, so you will have to upgrade Pip first.

```
# Check your pip version
pip -V
pip 9.0.1 from /home/e42/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (python 2.7)
pip3 -V
pip 9.0.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.5)

# If Pip is < Version 9
sudo pip install -U pip
```

The module is updated in Pypi (Python's package interface Pip) on a regular basis. So simply install the module like you would any Python module:

```
# Install the Polyglot interface
pip install polyinterface --user
```


### Starting your NodeServer build

When you start building a NodeServer you are helping build the free and open Internet of Things. Thank you! If you run in to any issues please ask your questions on the [UDI Polyglot Forums](http://forum.universal-devices.com/forum/111-polyglot/).

To get started, [use the python2/3 template.](https://github.com/Einstein42/udi-poly-template-python)

From there just read the code itself, it is fully explained step by step.
